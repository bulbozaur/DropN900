NOTE: This was a hobby project of mine to try out Maemo5 development when I got the N900.
      Since then Dropbox has deprecated the API version that this app is using, so DropN900
      will not (should not at least) longer work for anyone.
      
      I Don't have any plans to update to the new API due to 1) N900 is no longer my main
      phone 2) I don't have time for this project anymore.
      
      I'm sorry about this to all of the users this app gained over the years!

DropN900 - a maemo5 dropbox client
==================================

Dropbox released a public (mobile) API to their services some time ago.
As the maemo 5 platform was lacking a native client for the dropbox services,
I wanted to make one. I use the dropbox provided python API client and PyQt4.

Please visit the official thread of this app on maemo.org for more info

Release changelog

See Changelog.txt

Notes
=====

You cant do anything with this repo alone. There are alot python dependencies and some of them are
maemo 5 spesific. You can run this in the Maemo 5 SDK in scratchbox with proper deps installed,
but still you would be missing the dropbox app key that I wont share here for apparent reasons.
