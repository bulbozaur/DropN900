DropN900 - a maemo5 dropbox client
==================================

Dropbox released a public (mobile) API to their services some time ago.
As the maemo 5 platform was lacking a native client for the dropbox services,
I wanted to make one. I use the dropbox provided python API client and PyQt4.

Please visit the official thread of this app on maemo.org for more info

Release changelog
=================
See Changelog.txt

Notes
=====

You cant do anything with this repo alone. There are alot python dependencies and some of them are
maemo 5 spesific. You can run this in the Maemo 5 SDK in scratchbox with proper deps installed,
but still you would be missing the dropbox app key that I wont share here for apparent reasons.
