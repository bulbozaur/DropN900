dropn900-0.1.4-1 - 05.08.2010
* Bug fix: Certain themes had column width problems, so you could not see the item names without manual resize.
* Bug fix: Upload goes through, but fails on internal callback after thread finishes. This resulted in not fetching the new metadata automatically for parent folder after upload.
* App now uses unicode internally and for networking encodes to utf-8.
* -> Scandic letter now work and have been tested, any chars in utf-8 should work also of course.
* -> Tested files/paths with scandic chars: rename, new folder, download, remove, but on upload with scandics in file name dropbox refuses with "forbidden" response. This seems to be the only limitation.
* -> Errors on upload should show in transfers widget, and the transfer is set to failed state.
* -> Login email/password can now have non-ascii chars also.

dropn900-0.1.3-1 - 02.08.2010
* Bug fix: QTimers were not polling active threads due to qmainloopcontext.iteration() was blocking it.
* Bug fix: Download code was saying too early that file was ready, even 30mb files seemed to come in ~few seconds. This lead multiple downloads to be going at the same time, now only one at a time as intended from the beginning.
* New Feature: Recursive sync. Searches all subfolders for out of date or missing files and syncs them also
* More checking on sync start, wont start if existing active transfers or data writing to disk
* UI updates to transfer widget to show total sync stats
* When you sync for example /Photos, it now goes to <default_dl_dir>/Photos
