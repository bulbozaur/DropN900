dropn900-0.1.8-1 - 23.11.2010
* Sync upload/publish N900 camera folder content to dropbox path /N900Media/Photos and /N900Media/Videos
* -> Confirmation options to sync both videos and photos or just photos or videos. 
* -> .mp4 files are sorted to videos, everything else goes to photos. Subfolders in /home/user/MyDocs/DCIM are ignored.
* -> Will ask to create n900 media folders if not present. Hard coded to /N900Media/Photos and /N900Media/Videos paths so if you dont accept you cant use this feature.
* Fixed treeview column resizing bugs. Now auto resizes to content width every time treeview content changes.
* Fixed line edits being black with black text, now white bg with black text as normal.
* Made right side buttons a bit smaller with a bit smaller text, more space for horizontally long treeview item names.
* Some style changes to make things looks normal again after PR 1.3
* NOTE: Settings Sync Path selection button paint bug is known. Most likely wont show anything so you have trust what you insert in the popup when you press it. I guess QMaemo5ValueButton got twisted in PR 1.3, custom style sheets does not seem to do anything for this subclass of QPushButton.

dropn900-0.1.7-2 - 02.11.2010
* Fix PR 1.3 introduced bug: segfaults when initializing out QApplication instance.
* Removed false import left when debugging the issue on build 1.

dropn900-0.1.6-1 - 24.10.2010
* Separate confirm dialogs for upload and download
* Options in confirmation dialogs: Download/Upload Files, Cancel, Ignore Files and for upload dialog Delete Local Files.
* -> Delete Local Files: will remove all files that are marked as NEW FILE in known dropbox paths. If uploads still available after deletion, updates UI and reconfirms what to do. This will happen only if you have added new folders and files that are not present in the server, these you still have to delete manually if you dont want to sync them. Or just click ignore to not act on them.
* Transfers widgets cleaned up. Sync wont create widget per sync dl/ul, but a reporting widget that will track the progress of the sync. Showing stats: time spent on upload and download, how many files uploaded/downloaded and how many left and total size of uploads/downloads. Hopefully this will bring speed to the transfers view as there are alot less items in it now.
* Added small 'Sync Now' button to main views lower right corner. This same space will also show when a sync is in progress and the button goes away for that time.
* Made main tree view items a little bigger with bigger font so its easier to use without stylus.
* Internals: Much cleaner code all around for the sync ui part.

dropn900-0.1.5-3 - 13.09.2010
* Synchronization now goes both ways as follows
* -> Upload sync updates existing files that have newer timestamp and is different size compared to server file.
* -> Upload sync sends new files in existing dropbox paths
* -> Upload sync sends new local folders and files that do not exist in corresponding dropbox paths
* -> Upload sync will skip local paths that have non-ascii chars: my code would support this but dropbox python client does not however. It fails to open file objects that non-ascii chars.
* -> Upload sync will skip temp files that end with ~
* Sync reporting/confirmation dialog got a facelift
* Transfers manager updated to support sync uploads
* Removed python2.5-qt4-network and python2.5-qt4-webkit dependencies
* Created a new about dialog with more information on the app and paypal donate link

dropn900-0.1.4-1 - 05.08.2010
* Bug fix: Certain themes had column width problems, so you could not see the item names without manual resize.
* Bug fix: Upload goes through, but fails on internal callback after thread finishes. This resulted in not fetching the new metadata automatically for parent folder after upload.
* App now uses unicode internally and for networking encodes to utf-8.
* -> Scandic letter now work and have been tested, any chars in utf-8 should work also of course.
* -> Tested files/paths with scandic chars: rename, new folder, download, remove, but on upload with scandics in file name dropbox refuses with "forbidden" response. This seems to be the only limitation.
* -> Errors on upload should show in transfers widget, and the transfer is set to failed state.
* -> Login email/password can now have non-ascii chars also.

dropn900-0.1.3-1 - 02.08.2010
* Bug fix: QTimers were not polling active threads due to qmainloopcontext.iteration() was blocking it.
* Bug fix: Download code was saying too early that file was ready, even 30mb files seemed to come in ~few seconds. This lead multiple downloads to be going at the same time, now only one at a time as intended from the beginning.
* New Feature: Recursive sync. Searches all subfolders for out of date or missing files and syncs them also
* More checking on sync start, wont start if existing active transfers or data writing to disk
* UI updates to transfer widget to show total sync stats
* When you sync for example /Photos, it now goes to <default_dl_dir>/Photos

dropn900-0.1.2-2 - 30.07.2010
* Fixed fatal bug: app crashed and burned on start up for users that did not have /home/user/.dropn900 config dir.
